<h2>Pallet Lift Truck For Rent Geneseo</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle.

<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet.
