Reach truck with pantograph attachment that scissors forward from the mast.

Lencrow Forklifts has a range of new electric-powered order pickers to suit each operator style and handling application. The truck should be equipped with the attachment and the test load (when required) should be representative of the capacity of the truck and attachment combination.</p>
<p>Vertical masted rough terrain forklifts - If you're looking for a forklift that can be driven on uneven, muddy, or rough surfaces, this is the truck you need.
