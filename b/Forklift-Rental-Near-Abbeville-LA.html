Industrial trucks are categorized into seven classes based on characteristics, such as engine type, design and size.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions.
