The truck class always sees a wide variety of entries due to a thriving community of truck enthusiasts with a broad palate for styling designs; from some of the lowest frame draggers you'll ever see to skyjacker lifts that seem to touch the sky.

The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications.</p>
