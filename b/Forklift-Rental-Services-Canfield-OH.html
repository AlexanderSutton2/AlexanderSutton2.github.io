While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. As the fork lift trucks are usually quite expensive, many industry enterprises choose to buy used forklifts on industrial auctions, which reduces the cost of the process they implement.</p>

Where possible, fork loops or jugs should be provided for handling by fork trucks. Whilst implementing some or all of the relevant measures above will greatly reduce the fall risk to operators, the best solution is to provide order pickers with fully enclosed platforms.</p>
