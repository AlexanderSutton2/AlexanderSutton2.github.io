Pallet jacks - also called order pickers, typical pallet jacks can lift approximately 3,300 pounds. Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>Electric forklift trucks provide higher efficiency than the other forklift trucks, and also the components of this machine offer optimal productivity to all its applications. These trucks are very efficient in transporting heavy to very heavy materials from one place to another. Our rentals have the flexibility for daily, weekly or monthly rentals and allow you flexibility in your material handling needs.</p>

According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>
<p>Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs. All operators are required to wear a harness while operating any order picker at any height. Heli is China's number one manufacturer of forklifts and 6th largest in the world. OSHA standards require that the employer ensure that forklift operator is competent to operate the forklift he or she is assigned to use.</p>
<p>Forklift operators can lift up and lower the forks, use side shifters to move loads and tilt the mast so the load doesn't slide off the forks. The multidirectional BT Reflex F-series of reach trucks offer AC power, clear-view masts, 360° steering and sideways battery exchange for increased productivity and manoeuvrability. Aimed at a prosperous growth in this domain, we are engaged in offering an excellent quality range of Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck.</p>
