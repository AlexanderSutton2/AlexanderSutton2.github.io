High-Lift Platform Trucks — The maximum weight, expressed in pounds, at a specified load center that a truck can transport and stack to a height established by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>

If a lifted truck's front or rear bumper is 20 inches taller than a car bumper, we are looking at the truck's bumper clearing the car's hood and impacting the windshield.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>

Even if you are just going to operate a forklift one time for a specific job, OSHA requires that in addition to a license, you need to be certified to use a forklift and you also need authorization from your employer.

<p>We also operate three trucks for parts collection in Johannesburg and share the use of a warehouse facility in Jet Park for these conditions. For example a panto-graph reach forklift utilizes a scissor mechanism, allowing it to reach into racking with either a single or double reaching design. On the other hand, Europe is projected to witness significant growth in the global forklift trucks market.</p>

Widely used in construction for loads from 3,000 - 15,000lbs. Featuring an air spring with superior ride quality, this unit softens typical loaded ride conditions by transferring load from the vehicle's leaf spring to the Hellwig Air Spring.</p>
<p>The high-lifting capability of the reach truck makes it an ideal fit for distribution centers facing a shrinking labor pool and pressure to maximize vertical storage space to accommodate inventory growth driven by e-commerce.
