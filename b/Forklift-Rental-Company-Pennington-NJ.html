<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. These types of forklifts can accelerate and travel at higher speeds, which also makes them ideal for outdoor uses. More elaborate lift kits not only raise the body of your truck up but can also increase the clearance of your truck's frame and let you put bigger tires on your pickup.

<p>Class VII - Rough terrain forklift is a generic term used to describe forklifts typically intended for use on unimproved natural terrain and disturbed terrain construction sites.

<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
