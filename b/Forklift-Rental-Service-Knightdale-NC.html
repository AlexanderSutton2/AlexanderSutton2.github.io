<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction. Apart from this, these rental services are rendered according to the client's demands. They work better than 4-wheel forklifts where space is limited. This product range is capable of moving the heavy loads very easily and for the packing goods in warehouses, stores and factories.</p>

This is a unique walkie counterbalance truck which was designed to operate in a large chemical manufacturing facility.

They can reach heights up to 390â€³ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries.
