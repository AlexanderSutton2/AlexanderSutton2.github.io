Many models are equipped with stabilizers to ensure safe movement with shifting loads from one side of the machine to the other. When not in use, pallet jacks should be rolled into an area that does not have pedestrian traffic.</p>

Like how its name says, the side loader forklift can drive up alongside pallet racks or other industrial shelving and can unload without having to turn. Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilises a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>It's not as easy to see vehicles around your lifted truck, especially if they're smaller passenger occupant vehicles or bikes. Like an articulated forklift, a pivoting-mast forklift can rotate its mast at a 90-degree angle to its body. That's why it's nice to rent a forklift when required.
