This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>

The larger tires allowed by lifted trucks is one of the biggest advantages for going off-road with this type of vehicle.</p>
