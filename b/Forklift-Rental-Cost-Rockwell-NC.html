Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>

Pallet jacks offer sturdy steel construction and often feature cushion grip handles for comfort. The occurrence of a major rollover accident is increased because lifted trucks have beefier suspensions that require greater travel than a more modest truck or one that is not lifted at all.</p>
