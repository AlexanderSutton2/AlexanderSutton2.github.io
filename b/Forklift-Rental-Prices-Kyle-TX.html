<p>Buying a used lifted truck from helps New Braunfels drivers spend less money on a vehicle that has plenty of life left to give. In the region where I work, small businesses (as opposed to the large manufacturing and commercial construction companies I normally consult with) often lack the resources for safety training. The industrial forklift —also called a large capacity forklift—combines the functionalities of a warehouse forklift with that of a telehandler.</p>
