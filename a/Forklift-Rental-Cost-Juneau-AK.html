An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>
<p>Also, aftermarket installations like a lift kit can void the warranty on a lot of vehicles - that's a lot of benefits to leave on the table. Establish a timeline of how long your rental will last. We are able to meet your long-term and short-term forklift requirements whether you are based within close proximity to a major city or in a small town.
