On October 4, 2017, United Rentals announced it had acquired the assets of Superior Speedie Portable Services, Inc.

We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

The increased tire size and ground clearance makes off-roading increasingly possible by limiting the potential damage of debris, as well as providing an overall smoother ride across the rough ground.</p>

Leveling Lift Kit: This is the most affordable kind of lift kit and is best for those who just want to look bigger on the road, because they only lift the front end and don't offer a significant enhancement to off-road trail performance.
