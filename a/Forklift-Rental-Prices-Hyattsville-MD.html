<p>Our range of products include Order Picker Forklift and Forklift Truck. Ground clearance same as cushion tire forklift. This forklift is available for rent. However, the additional weight and size from wheels or tires will put more resistance on your lifted truck and may cause extra wear and tear. Read on to learn the Pros and Cons of stand-up forklifts. We provide learners with the skills and knowledge to correctly, safely and legally operate a range of Fork Trucks in the workplace.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
