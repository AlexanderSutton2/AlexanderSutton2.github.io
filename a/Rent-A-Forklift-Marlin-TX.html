Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>
