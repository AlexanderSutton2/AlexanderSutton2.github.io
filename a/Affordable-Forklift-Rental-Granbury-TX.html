Whether they be a factory-floor, rough terrain, or telehandler machine, forklifts often face far harder service than most farm machinery. Although a primitive pissing contest in the eyes of some, the lifted-truck community does get down and dirty in some sections; namely the mudder section.</p>
<p>This mainly due to the growing demand for material handling equipment across the manufacturing industry. The 8,000 lb. electric 4-wheel is used in higher capacity operations. Regardless of whether you are looking for routine lifted truck maintenance or extensive collision repair, we've got you covered at Laura Buick GMC. There has been talk of making DOT crash bars mandatory on all lifted vehicles, to help eliminate stock-height vehicles from continuing underneath a lifted vehicle.</p>

Mitsubishi counterbalance forklifts are designed for exceptional comfort and increased productivity - from beginning of the shift to the end. Some order pickers are in a climate-controlled environment, while others work in sub-freezing temperatures.
